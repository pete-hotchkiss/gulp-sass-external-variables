# gulp-sass-external-variables

Parses and external JSON source, injecting properties which are subsequently available as part of SASS processing

_**Note**_: This is heavily based on the seemingly inactive [gulp-json-sass]( https://github.com/rbalicki2/gulp-json-sass) so much of the credit must go to it's author.

My beef with that was it wasn't the greatest at handling complex object structures, and I wanted a way to parse ```JSON.array``` values to SASS Lists.

**_Coming Soon_**: Parsing Object structures to Maps ( for SASS 3.3 and beyond )

## Installing

The usual npm jive to install module and all it's dependencies...

```npm i --save gulp-sass-external-variables```
